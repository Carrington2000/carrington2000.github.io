<div class="lead">
<p>I enjoy developing tools that empower teachers to achieve greater impact — delivering actionable data while lightening workload.</p>
<p>With 15 years experience, I’ve taught across every primary grade level and contributed through a wide range of leadership roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Every resource you’ll find here is my own work. While the Department holds the intellectual property, they’re shared freely to support fellow educators.</p>
<p>If you find value in my work, I’d appreciate an acknowledgement or hearing how you’ve used it. And if you’re feeling generous, you’re welcome to shout me a coffee.</p>
