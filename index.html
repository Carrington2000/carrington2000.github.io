<div class="lead">
  <p>I enjoy developing tools that empower teachers to achieve greater impact by delivering actionable data while lightening workload.</p>
  <p>With 15 years experience, I’ve taught across every primary grade level and contributed through a wide range of leadership roles and responsibilities.</p>
  <p>Every resource you’ll find here is my own work. While the Department <a href="https://www2.education.vic.gov.au/pal/intellectual-property-and-copyright/policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">holds the intellectual property</a>, they’re shared freely to support fellow educators.</p>
  <p>If you find value in my work, I’d appreciate an acknowledgement or hearing how you’ve used it. And if you’re feeling generous, you’re welcome to shout me a coffee.</p>
