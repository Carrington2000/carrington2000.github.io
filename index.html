<p>I enjoy developing tools that help teachers achieve greater impact by providing actionable data and reducing workload.</p>
<p>I create all the resources on my website myself. Although the Department retains ownership, I share them freely to support fellow educators..</p>
<p>If you find value in what I’ve created, I’d be grateful if you could acknowledge the source or share how you’ve used it. And if you’re feeling generous, you're welcome to shout me a coffee!</p>
