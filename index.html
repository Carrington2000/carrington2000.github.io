title: Hi, 
subtitle: I'm a Learning Specialist in the Victorian state education system. I enjoy developing tools for real classroom teachers that maximise impact, obtain actionable insights into learning and minimizing time constraints on busy educators. All resources on my website are created entirely by me. While the Department considers itself the owner of my work, I share everything freely to support fellow educators. If you find value in what I’ve created, I’d be grateful if you could acknowledge the source or share how you’ve used it. I would love to hear how you have used my work. And if you’re feeling generous, you're welcome to shout me a coffee!
