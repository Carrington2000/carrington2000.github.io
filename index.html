<p>I enjoy developing tools that help teachers achieve greater impact by providing actionable data and reducing workload.</p>
<p>I create all the resources on my website myself. While the Department owns the intellectual property I create in the course of my work, I share it freely to support fellow educators.</p>
<p>If you find value in my work, I’d appreciate an acknowledgement or hearing how you’ve used it. And if you’re feeling generous, you’re welcome to shout me a coffee.</p>
