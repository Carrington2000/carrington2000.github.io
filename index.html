  <h1 class="hero-title">Hi</h1>
  <h2 class="hero-subtitle">I am a teacher in the Victorian public education system.</h2>
  <p>I enjoy developing tools that empower teachers to achieve greater impact by delivering actionable data while lightening workload.</p>
  <p>With 15 years experience, I’ve taught across every primary grade level and contributed through a wide range of leadership roles and responsibilities.</p>
  <p>Every resource you’ll find here is my own work. While the Department <a href="https://www2.education.vic.gov.au/pal/intellectual-property-and-copyright/policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">holds the intellectual property</a>, they’re shared freely to support fellow educators.</p>
  <p>If my work has been valuable to you, I’d love to hear how you’ve used it. Otherwise, a brief acknowledgment to credit the original work is always appreciated.</p>
