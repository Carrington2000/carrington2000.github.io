<div class="lead">
<p>I enjoy developing tools for real classroom teachers that maximise impact, obtain actionable insights into learning and minimizing time constraints on busy educators.</p>
<p>All resources on my website are created entirely by me. While the Department considers itself the owner of my work, I share everything freely to support fellow educators.</p>
<p>If you find value in what I’ve created, I’d be grateful if you could acknowledge the source or share how you’ve used it. I would love to hear how you have used my work. And if you’re feeling generous, you're welcome to shout me a coffee!</p>
